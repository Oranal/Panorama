for runnig this file:
1. need to have the following packages:
-os
-sys
-numpy
-opencv
-matplotlib
2.create a new empty dirctory

3.download the pictures from model, put the pictures every where you want(in the input directory you will create).
3.1 if your os language is in Hebrew you should put the input directory  where you will able to execute the path in English.

4.for execute the program you will run from the cmd(or git bash command) the following command:
    4.1 python Panorama.py left_image_path right_image_path output_directory_path.
    4.2 explanation of the following command:
    - Panorama.py the python script for execute the panorama image, 
        so if you will change the name of the script you will need to run with the new name of the script.
    -for runnig the script you will need to open cmd(or git bash command) in the script directory or put the path of the script insted of the script name (don't forget to put .py and the ending of the script name).
    - input_directory will contain all the images from the pictures dirctory.
    - output_directory will be empty for the panorama images.
    4.3 the step before executing:
    - open cmd or git bash at the Panorama.py path,
    otherwise you will need to enter the full path for them.
    -very important to get the whole path in English otherwise its doesn't work.
5. thanks for reading and have fun for using this program.
